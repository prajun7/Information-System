<!-- 
Assume you’re a developer for a school. 
You’re tasked with creating a student information system. The idea is simple:
There will be a form where you can write student’s name, age and address
Upon clicking an Add button, the student information will be added to table that resides just below the form
In each table row, there will be a Delete button. Upon clicking that button, the student will be removed from the table
Based on these requirements, implement this system. 
The requirement is very simple and do exactly as you’re told, no extra things are required. 
Optionally try to style your web page with CSS to make it look good.
