# Information System

This program is designed to get data from the users and store those data in a table.
Also, there is an option to delete unnecessary data from the table with just a click. 

This program can be used to store information about the students, employees, or some people.
There is a form where the user can write the information about the people.
Upon clicking an Add button, the information will be added to the table that resides just below the form.
In each table row, there is a Delete button. 
Upon clicking that button, the user will be removed from the table...

**I am using vanilla JavaScript and HTML to create the form.**
